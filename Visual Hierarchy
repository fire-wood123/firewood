We need to do the following to improve our visual hierarchy:
• Call-to-Action (CTA) Buttons: Ensure that CTAs stand out with distinct colors, sizes, or shapes to guide users towards completing desired actions
 • Prioritize Important Information: Make sure that the most important information or functionality is located prominently in the UI. Use headers, bold fonts, or color contrast to highlight it.
 • Whitespace: Use ample whitespace to reduce visual clutter and direct users' attention to key elements
